( CBT, gestalt, jungian) to phisical, art and others. Go through all of them an use those generalisations in a fractal way. The way nature is fractal and all the patterns follow on the same meta scale level, in that way do the same and mapp different patterns that happen across 
these therapies. We are looking for a abstract principle that happens, viewing it as an energetical pattern that happens between those people doing therapy. Also take into account when people do therapeutic work by themsleves like writing, sport or excercise or going out socialising. Those are all forms of therapy, or form of a behaviour that takes a human from feeling unstable to feeling stable and hungry for life. 
now take that principle and answer the tweet above with knowledge from that. With a single line of thought
Finish with a single combination of the synthesised idea in form of a thought. Make it very human like and naturalistic sounding but with a dose of sarcasam and wit, something like holy scripture sounding paragraph but making fun with it without limits. Important: Choose only one discrete thought,
